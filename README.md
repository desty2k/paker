Paker is module for importing Python packages/modules from dictionaries and JSON formatted documents. 
It was inspired by [httpimporter](https://github.com/operatorequals/httpimport).

__Important:__ Since v0.6.0 `paker` supports importing `.pyd` and `.dll` modules directly from memory. 
This was achieved by using `_memimporter` from [py2exe](https://github.com/py2exe/py2exe) project.
Importing `.so` files on Linux still requires writing them to disk.

## Installation
From PyPI

```shell
pip install paker -U
```

From source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/desty2k/paker.git
cd paker
pip install .
```

## Usage

### In Python script

You can import Python modules directly from string, dict or bytes (without disk IO).

```python

import paker
import logging

MODULE = {"somemodule": {"type": "module", "extension": "py", "code": "fun = lambda x: x**2"}}
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.NOTSET)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with paker.loads(MODULE) as loader:
        # somemodule will be available only in this context
        from somemodule import fun
        assert fun(2), 4
        assert fun(5), 25
        print("6**2 is {}".format(fun(6)))
        print("It works!")

```

To import modules from `.json` files use `load` function.
In this example paker will serialize and import [mss](https://pypi.org/project/mss/) package.

```python

import paker
import logging

file = "mss.json"
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.NOTSET)

# install mss using `pip install mss`
# serialize module
with open(file, "w+") as f:
    paker.dump("mss", f, indent=4)

# now you can uninstall mss using `pip uninstall mss -y`
# load package back from dump file
with open(file, "r") as f:
    loader = paker.load(f)

import mss
with mss.mss() as sct:
    sct.shot()

# remove loader and clean the cache
loader.unload()

try:
    # this will throw error
    import mss
except ImportError:
    print("mss unloaded successfully!")

```


### CLI
Paker can also work as a standalone script.
To dump module to JSON dict use `dump` command:

```shell
paker dump mss
```

To recreate module from JSON dict use `load`:

```shell
paker load mss.json
```

Show all modules and packages in `.json` file

```shell
paker list mss.json
```

## How it works

When importing modules or packages Python iterates over [importers](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-importer) in `sys.meta_path` and calls `find_module` method on each object.
If the importer returns `self`, it means that the module can be imported and `None` means that importer did not find searched package.
If any importer has confirmed the ability to import module, Python executes another method on it - `load_module`.
Paker implements its own importer called `jsonimporter`, which instead of searching for modules in directories, looks for them in Python dictionaries

To dump module or package to JSON document, Paker recursively iterates over modules and creates dict with 
code and type of each module and submodules if object is package.
